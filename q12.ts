// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.


let names = ["ahmed","taha","abbas","wahab"]

console.log(`${names[0]} you are my best friend`);
console.log(`${names[1]} you are my best friend`);
console.log(`${names[2]} you are my best friend`);
console.log(`${names[3]} you are my best friend`);
