// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
var names = ["ahmed", "taha", "abbas", "wahab"];
console.log("".concat(names[0], " you are my best friend"));
console.log("".concat(names[1], " you are my best friend"));
console.log("".concat(names[2], " you are my best friend"));
console.log("".concat(names[3], " you are my best friend"));
