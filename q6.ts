// Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces


let myname:string="\t ABDUL RAFAY \n"

//with white space

console.log(`print name with whitespace ${myname}`);

//without white space

let namewithoutwhitespace:string=myname.trim()
console.log(`print name without whitespace ${namewithoutwhitespace}`);
