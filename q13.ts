// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”



let cars = ["city","civic","mehran","corolla"]

console.log(`I love ${cars[0]} because its fuel average is too good`);
console.log(`I love ${cars[1]} because its design is so beautiful`);
console.log(`I love ${cars[2]} because its budget friendly`);
console.log(`I love ${cars[0]} because its built quality`);
